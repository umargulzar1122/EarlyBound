# EarlyBound
Early Bound Classes in C# for Dynamics 365 are strongly typed representations of entities in Dataverse (formerly CDS). These classes are generated using the build command  / CrmSvcUtil tool and provide compile-time checking, IntelliSense support, and better performance when interacting with Dynamics 365 data.
