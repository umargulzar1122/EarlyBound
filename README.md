# EarlyBound
Early Bound Classes in C# for Dynamics 365 are strongly typed representations of entities in Dataverse (formerly CDS). These classes are generated using the build command  / CrmSvcUtil tool and provide compile-time checking, IntelliSense support, and better performance when interacting with Dynamics 365 data.


This repository guides generating early-bound classes for use with the Microsoft Dataverse SDK for .NET. Early-bound classes enhance development by offering:

Improved Code Readability and Maintainability: Strongly typed classes represent Dataverse entities, making code more intuitive.

# Compile-Time Type Checking: 
  Reduces runtime errors by ensuring type safety during development.
  Enhanced Developer Productivity: Utilize IntelliSense to discover tables, columns, and choice options.
  
# LINQ Query Support: 
  Leverage the OrganizationServiceContext class to write LINQ queries against Dataverse data.
